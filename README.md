# An-Understanding-of-Covid-19-in-India
As the number of deaths due to Covid-19 pandemic is increasing and one would like to know when it will start decreasing. My motivation comes from the SIRD (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead) model in the paper by Anastassopoulou et al.
We have worked on fitting an ODE to the number of deaths per day due to Covid-19.
Also, after working on an equation with two arbitary constants, the results of the two models are compared.
The second part of the project involves machine learning approach for finding the rate of decay using time series analysis. Various Regression and Arima models have been used.
I'm still working on the project, finding better clinical data that may help in the better understanding of the pandemic.
